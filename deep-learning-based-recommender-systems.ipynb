    "# Deep Learning based Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, recommender systems are based on methods such as clustering, nearest neighbor and matrix factorization. However, in recent years, deep learning has yielded tremendous success across multiple domains, from image recognition to natural language processing. Recommender systems have also benefited from deep learning's success. In fact, today's state-of-the-art recommender systems such as those at [YouTube](https://research.google/pubs/pub45530/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/the-history-of-amazons-recommendation-algorithm) are powered by complex deep learning systems, and less so on traditional methods."

    "# Building Recommender Systems using Implicit Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build our model, it is important to understand the distinction between *implicit* and *explicit* feedback in the context of recommender systems, and why modern recommender systems are built on implicit feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of recommender systems, explicit feedback are **direct** and **quantitative** data collected from users. For example, Amazon allows users to rate purchased items on a scale of 1-10. These ratings are provided directly from users, and the scale allows Amazon to quantify user preference. Another example of explicit feedback includes the thumbs up button on YouTube, which captures users' explicit preference (i.e. like or dislike) of a particular video.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the problem with explicit feedback is that they are rare. If you think about it, when was the last time you clicked the like button on a YouTube video, or rated your online purchases? Chances are, the amount of videos you watch on YouTube is far greater than the amount of videos that you have explicitly rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, implicit feedback are collected indirectly from user **interactions**, and they act as a proxy for user preference. For example. videos that you watch on YouTube are used as implicit feedback to tailor recommendations for you, even if you don't rate the videos explicitly. Another example of implicit feedback includes the items that you have browsed on Amazon, which are used to suggest other similar items for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of implicit feedback is that it is abundant. Recommender systems built using implicit feedback also allows us to tailor recommendations in real time, with every click and interaction. Today, online recommender systems are built using implicit feedback, which allows the system to tune its recommendation in real-time, with every user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, implicit feedback has its shortcomings as well. Unlike explicit feedback, every interaction is assumed to be positive and we are unable to capture negative preference from users. How then do we capture negative feedback? One technique that can be applied is negative sampling, which we will go through in a later section."

    "# Our model - Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many deep learning based architecture for recommendation systems, I find that the framework proposed by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031) is the most straightforward and it is simple enough to be implemented in a tutorial such as this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the architecture of the model, let's familiarize ourselves with the concept of embeddings. An embedding is a low-dimensional space that captures the relationship of vectors from a higher dimensional space. To better understand this concept, let's take a closer look at user embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we want to represent our users according to their preference for two genres of movies - action and romance movies. Let the first dimension be how much the user likes action movies, and the second dimension be how much the user likes romance movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/XENzqXq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assume that Bob is our first user. Bob likes action movies but isn't a fan of romance movies. To represent Bob as a two dimensional vector, we place him in the graph according to his preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/rSStTCj.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next user is Joe. Joe is a huge fan of both action and romance movies. We represent Joe using a two dimensional vector just like Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/gmmkrEU.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This two dimensional space is known as an embedding. Essentially, the embedding reduces our users such that they can be represented in a meaningful manner in a lower dimensional space. In this embedding, users with similar movie preferences are placed near to each other, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/9s9Z7JT.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we are not restricted to using just 2 dimensions to represent our users. We can use an arbitrary number of dimensions to represent our users. A larger number of dimensions would allow us to capture the traits of each user more accurately, at the cost of model complexity. In our code, we'll use 8 dimensions (which we will see later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learned Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we will use a separate item embedding layer to represent the traits of the items (i.e. movies) in a lower dimensional space. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering, how can we learn the weights of the embedding layer, such that it provides an accurate representation of users and items? In our previous example, we used Bob and Joe's preference for action and romance movies to manually create our embedding. Is there a way to learn such preferences automatically? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **Collaborative Filtering** - by using the ratings dataset, we can identify similar users and movies, creating user and item embeddings learned from existing ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a better understanding of embeddings, we are ready to define the model architecture. As you'll see, the user and item embeddings are key to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ![NCF](https://i.imgur.com/EZh1HHf.png)\n",
    " -->\n",
    " \n",
    "Let's walk through the model architecture using the following training sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "| userId | movieID | interacted |\n",
    "|-|-|-|\n",
    "| 3 | 1 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/cNWbIce.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to the model are the one-hot encoded user and item vector for `userId = 3` and `movieId = 1`. Because this is a positive sample (movie actually rated by the user), the true label (`interacted`) is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user input vector and item input vector are fed to the user embedding and item embedding respectively, which results in a smaller, denser user and item vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The embedded user and item vectors are concatenated before passing through a series of fully connected layers, which maps the concatenated embeddings into a prediction vector as output. Finally, we apply a `Sigmoid` function to obtain the most probable class. In the example above, the most probable class is 1 (positive class), since 0.8 > 0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Now that our model is trained, we are ready to evaluate it using the test data. In traditional Machine Learning projects, we evaluate our models using metrics such as Accuracy (for classification problems) and RMSE (for regression problems). However, such metrics are too simplistic for evaluating recommender systems.\n",

    "The key here is that we don't need the user to interact on *every* single item in the list of recommendations. Instead, we just need the user to interact with at least one item on the list - as long as the user does that, the recommendations have worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate this, let's run the following evaluation protocol to generate a list of 10 recommended items for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each user, randomly select 99 items that the user **has not interacted with**\n",
    "* Combine these 99 items with the test item (the actual item that the user interacted with). We now have 100 items.\n",
    "* Run the model on these 100 items, and rank them according to their predicted probabilities\n",
    "* Select the top 10 items from the list of 100 items. If the test item is present within the top 10 items, then we say that this is a hit.\n",
    "* Repeat the process for all users. The Hit Ratio is then the average hits.\n",
