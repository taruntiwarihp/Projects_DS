1. **Project P75I Delays**:
   - There is a potential delay of 6-9 months in the P75I project due to the Spain/Navantia AIP not being ready.
   - Field evaluation trials of MDL and TKMS have been successful, but further comments on the delay were not provided.

2. **Margin Improvement**:
   - The company has seen a significant improvement in margins, which were previously around 5-6%.
   - This improvement is attributed to operational efficiencies and before-time deliveries.
   - Sustainable margins going forward are uncertain due to the nature of contracts (nomination basis vs. competitive basis).

3. **Contract Nature and Margins**:
   - Current contracts are on a nomination basis, which has predefined margins.
   - Future projects like next-generation destroyers and follow-on ships of 17 Bravo frigates may not have clear contours yet, affecting margin predictability.
   - The long execution period of projects means that a clearer picture of costs and margins emerges only in the later stages of project execution.

4. **Budget and Revenue Booking**:
   - The spending for the naval fleet in the interim budget is consistent with the previous year.
   - Many ships are in advanced stages of revenue booking, which could imply steady revenue streams in the near term.

### Investment Considerations

- **Operational Efficiency**: The company has demonstrated improved operational efficiency, leading to better margins.
- **Project Delays**: Potential delays in significant projects like P75I could impact timelines and financials.
- **Contract Nature**: The nature of future contracts (nomination vs. competitive) will significantly influence margins and profitability.
